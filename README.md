# Deep-SDM
 A Python-based integrated collaborative platform built on top of Tensorflow/Keras and written in the Jupyter Notebook.
This repository is created as part of our collaborative research on development of Deep-SDM: A Unified Computational Framework for Sequential Data Modeling using Deep Learning Models. It provides several object-oriented functionalities for implementing
LSTM, GRU, and CNN models. Multiple subroutines are blended to create a conducive user-friendly environment that facilitates
data exploration, input preparation, model creation, hyperparameter tuning, performance evaluations, visualization of results, and statistical analysis.

The code can be executed on popular platforms such as Google Colab and Ananconda.
