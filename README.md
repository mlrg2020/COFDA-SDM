# COFDA-SDM
 A Python-based integrated collaborative platform built on top of Tensorflow/Keras and written in the Jupyter Notebook.
This repository is created as part of our collaborative research on development of COFDA-SDM: Cooperative  Computational 
Framework of Deep Learning Architecture  for Sequential Data Modeling. It provides several object-oriented functionalities for implementing
LSTM, GRU, and CNN models. Multiple subroutines are blended to create a conducive user-friendly environment that facilitates
data exploration and visualization, normalization, and input preparation, hyperparameter tuning, performance
evaluations, visualization of results, and statistical analysis.
